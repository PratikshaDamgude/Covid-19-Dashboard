The primary objective of this Power BI project is to design an interactive and insightful COVID-19 Dashboard that enables users to analyze and visualize key pandemic-related metrics. The dashboard aims to:

Track COVID-19 Trends – Display global and regional COVID-19 statistics, including total cases, recoveries, and fatalities over time.
Enhance Data-Driven Decision Making – Provide stakeholders with real-time insights into infection rates, vaccination progress, and healthcare capacity.
Identify Patterns and Hotspots – Utilize heatmaps and trend analysis to highlight affected areas and predict potential outbreaks.
Compare Country and Region Data – Offer comparative analysis of COVID-19 impact across different countries and regions.
Visualize Vaccination Progress – Showcase vaccination rates, doses administered, and population coverage across locations.
